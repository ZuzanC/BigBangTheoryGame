Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is an extended version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, made popular by **The Big Bang Theory**. 
In this version, two players (human vs. computer) choose one of five options: **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard,** or **Spock**. The game compares the player's choice against the computer's random selection and determines the winner based on a set of rules. The objective is to outsmart the computer and win as many rounds as possible. The score is tracked, and the counters reset when the page is reloaded.

- **HTML**: The frontend is built using **HTML** to structure the game interface, including buttons for each game choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock) and a results display area.

- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, **Tailwind CSS** is used to create a clean, responsive, and modern design. Tailwind's utility-first approach allows for rapid customization and flexibility in the layout and design of the game interface.
